# About this project
<p>
This is a simple project of creating a simple application to implement RPC server in the app.
<p>

<p>  
Our programs (both client and server) were created in python language using xmlrpc package,  which provides modules for implementing the XML-RPC protocol for both clients and servers. XML-RPC is a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) method that utilizes XML over HTTP for communication. This allows a client to invoke methods on a remote server, passing parameters and receiving structured data in return.
<p>

<p>
In our application, the server side is responsible for adding two inputted numbers and give the result back to the client, whereas the client can input 2 numbers in the terminal and get the result back from the server. After the result, client can chooses to either continue the program or quit the program, by typing yes or no.
<p>

# How to run the program

First run the server by writing this in the terminal
```
python server.py
```

After that run the client code
```
python client.py
```
